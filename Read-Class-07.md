# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
*some guy that his smart and he helped write the first web servers*
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
*they weren't designed to be used like that.When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.*
**
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
*applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.*
4. What does a GET do?
*GET is used to request data from a specified resource.*
5. What does a POST do?
*add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.*
6. What does PUT do?
*system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT*
7. What does PATCH do?
*do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH*
