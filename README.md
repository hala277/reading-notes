## *Growth mindset: ðŸ§ :*
**A growth mindset holds that one's core skills may be developed via hard work and dedication; intelligence and talent are just beginning points. A passion of learning is linked with a development mentality.**

## In the other hand:

## *Fixed mindsets:*
**a fixed mindseets regard intelligence and skill as fixed attributes, implying that success is based only on these innate abilities, with no need for additional growth or effort.**

## The distinctions between a fixed and a growth mindset are as follows:

## How to Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset in 5 steps:
##
### **1.Challenges:**
**when you face a problem try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When you are ready, try to walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. And you can try to talk through these steps â€“ out loud, not just in your head. you can try to jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough you will begin to find the root causes of the problem.**

### **2.Obstacles:**
**when you face Obstacles the solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when youâ€™re feeling more inspired.**

### **3.Effort:**
**when you find yourself tired and you can't do anything ask yourself if that what you really want to do ? or do you going to giving up too easily?  and then you will know the true answer.**

### **4.Criticism:**
**try to  ask yourself two questions:**
+ What was the best part of the day?
+ What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?

**These questions might help you focus on all aspects of your day, the good and the bad, and they might help you internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.**

**And it turns out, variations of these questions might help you process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid, you can hold a mini-retrospective with yourself:**
+ Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
+ What can I do to improve the aspects Iâ€™m less proud of?

### **5.Success of others:**
**Try to see the success of others as a growth mindset encourages you to succeed and inspires you.**
