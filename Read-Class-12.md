## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

|SQL|NoSQL|
|-----|-----|
|primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.|
|table based databases|document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.|
|have predefined schema|have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
|SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware|NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.|

### 1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

*SQL databases are table based databases This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables.*

### 2. Give a real world example

2. *CouchDB,a document based NoSQL database. It stores data in form of JSON documents.*

### 5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

*NoSQL database.*

### 6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

*SQL Database.*
